# Machine Learning Model Deployment Strategies

## Introduction
Machine Learning model deployment is the process of making trained models available for inference in production environments. This critical phase transforms experimental models into business-value generating systems.

## Deployment Patterns

### Batch Inference
Batch inference processes large volumes of data at scheduled intervals. Use cases include daily recommendation updates, fraud detection on transaction batches, and customer segmentation analysis.

### Real-time Inference  
Real-time inference serves individual predictions with low latency. Common applications include recommendation engines, fraud detection systems, and chatbot responses.

### Streaming Inference
Processes continuous data streams for near real-time insights. Used for IoT sensor data processing, financial market analysis, and network security monitoring.

## Model Serving Architectures

### Microservices Architecture
Each model deployed as independent service, providing scalability and maintainability while allowing technology diversity.

### Model-as-a-Service (MaaS)
Centralized model serving platform with shared infrastructure, standardized APIs, and multi-tenancy support.

### Edge Deployment
Models deployed close to data sources, reducing latency and bandwidth while working with intermittent connectivity.

## Best Practices

1. Start with simple deployment patterns
2. Implement comprehensive monitoring early  
3. Design for scalability from the beginning
4. Plan for model updates and rollbacks
5. Document all deployment configurations
